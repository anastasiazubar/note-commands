You’re right — the API is currently listed in the deny list. Could you please review the ticket, which was created on 10/26/2022, and confirm whether this deny rule still needs to be enforced?

Additionally, please update the whitelist to reflect the current state, as several new service accounts and teams have been added since then.

Thank you!
