Key Differences:
Scope:

managed.iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload applies only to managed service accounts (those controlled by Google Cloud services).
boolean.iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload applies to all service accounts, including those created by users.
Use Case:

If you want to only restrict key uploads for Google-managed service accounts but allow key uploads for user-created service accounts, use managed.iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload.
If you want to completely prevent key uploads for all service accounts, use boolean.iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload.
Which One to Use?
If your organization wants a strict security policy that prohibits all service account key uploads, use boolean.iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload.
If your organization only wants to limit key uploads for Google-managed service accounts while allowing user-created service accounts to upload keys, use managed.iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload.


Constraint Name	Type	Description	Use Case
managed.iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload	Managed	Prevents uploading service account keys for managed service accounts.	This is specifically for managed service accounts, such as Google-managed service accounts used by GCP services (e.g., Cloud Run, Cloud Functions).
boolean.iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload	Boolean	Prevents uploading service account keys for all service accounts (both managed and user-created).	This applies to all service accounts within the organization, enforcing a stricter policy.

Yes, the distinction between iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation and iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation follows the same pattern as the previous constraints:

Constraint Name	Type	Description	Use Case
iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation	Boolean	Prevents creating new private keys for all service accounts (both user-created and managed by Google Cloud services).	Use this when you want to fully restrict service account key creation across your organization to enforce security best practices.
iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation	Managed	Prevents creating new private keys for Google-managed service accounts only.	Use this if you want to restrict key creation only for Google-managed service accounts while allowing user-managed service accounts to create keys.
Key Differences:
Scope:

iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation applies to all service accounts.
iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation applies only to Google-managed service accounts (e.g., Cloud Run, Cloud Functions service accounts).
Use Case:

If your security policy requires completely disabling key creation across your entire organization, use iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation.
If you only want to enforce this restriction on Google-managed service accounts, but allow key creation for user-managed service accounts, use iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation.
Which One Should You Use?
For stronger security and to enforce IAM best practices, use iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation to ensure no one creates potentially unsafe service account keys.
If you need a more flexible approach, where only Google-managed service accounts are restricted but developers can still generate keys for user-managed service accounts, use iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation.

iam.managed.preventPrivilegedBasicRolesForDefaultServiceAccounts

To prevent default service accounts from being granted the Editor or Owner roles, use the iam.managed.preventPrivilegedBasicRolesForDefaultServiceAccounts managed constraint. This constraint prevents default service accounts from ever being granted the Editor or Owner roles, either automatically or manually.

https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-service-accounts

Note: This constraint prevents default service accounts from being automatically granted the Editor role (roles/editor). However, it doesn't prevent default service accounts from being granted the Editor or Owner roles later. To disable the automatic Editor role grant and prevent the Editor and Owner roles from being granted to default service accounts in the future, use the iam.managed.preventPrivilegedBasicRolesForDefaultServiceAccounts managed constraint.
